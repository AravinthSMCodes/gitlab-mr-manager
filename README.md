## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- GitLab instance (self-hosted or GitLab.com)
- GitLab Personal Access Token
- Redis (for caching functionality)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gitlab-mr-manager.git
   cd gitlab-mr-manager
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup Redis (for caching)**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the automated setup script
   python setup_redis.py
   
   # Option 2: Manual Redis installation
   # macOS:
   brew install redis
   brew services start redis
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install redis-server
   sudo systemctl start redis-server
   
   # Windows:
   # Download Redis from https://redis.io/download
   ```

5. **Configure GitLab access**
   ```bash
   export GITLAB_TOKEN="your-gitlab-personal-access-token"
   export GITLAB_URL="https://git.csez.zohocorpin.com"  # Your GitLab instance URL
   export PROJECT_ID="16895"  # Your GitLab project ID
   ```

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5001`

## Redis Caching

The application uses Redis to cache frequently accessed data for improved performance. The following endpoints are cached for 24 hours:

- **`/api/labels`** - GitLab project labels
- **`/api/reviewers`** - Available reviewers from MRs
- **`/api/authors`** - MR authors

### Cache Management

The application provides several endpoints for cache management:

- **`GET /api/cache/status`** - Check cache status and TTL for each cached endpoint
- **`POST /api/cache/clear`** - Clear all cache data
- **`POST /api/cache/clear/<type>`** - Clear specific cache type (labels/reviewers/authors)

### Redis Configuration

You can configure Redis connection settings using environment variables:

```bash
export REDIS_HOST='localhost'      # Redis server host (default: localhost)
export REDIS_PORT='6379'           # Redis server port (default: 6379)
export REDIS_DB='0'                # Redis database number (default: 0)
export REDIS_PASSWORD=''           # Redis password (default: none)
```

### Cache Benefits

- **Faster Page Loads**: Cached data loads instantly instead of making API calls
- **Reduced API Calls**: Fewer requests to GitLab API, reducing rate limiting
- **Better User Experience**: Smoother filtering and dropdown population
- **Reduced Server Load**: Less processing required for frequently accessed data

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | GitLab Personal Access Token | Yes | (empty) |
| `GITLAB_URL` | URL of your GitLab instance | Yes | `https://git.csez.zohocorpin.com` |
| `PROJECT_ID` | GitLab project ID | Yes | `16895` |

### GitLab Personal Access Token

To use the GitLab API features, you'll need to create a personal access token:

1. Go to your GitLab instance
2. Navigate to **User Settings** ‚Üí **Access Tokens**
3. Create a new token with the following scopes:
   - `read_api`
   - `write_repository`
   - `read_repository`
   - `api`

## API Endpoints

The application provides several REST API endpoints:

### MR Management
